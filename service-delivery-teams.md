## Service Delivery Teams

Service Delivery Teams are our unit of delivery. Teams are cross-functional, composed of the right people to do the work.

Each team has a theme aligned with an area of University business and owns a group of services and related user journeys. We anticipate that the themes may change over time, but we will not expect the themes to change frequently.

Examples could include:

* Student Experience
* Teaching and Learning
* Research and Data
* Corporate Services
* Identity
* Business Transformation

Having teams dedicated to a specific theme allows them to develop expertise in that area and build relationships with users and stakeholders in that space. Teams are encouraged to collaborate and work together if they find common elements in their work.

Teams should implement the correct measurements and metrics for their work, allowing them to measure their own progress and impact, as well as share progress with interested parties.

We provide the following support mechanisms for people working in a service delivery team:

* A transfer process for people to move teams. If an individual wishes to move between teams they should speak to their line manager in the first instance, who will initiate the process. The move will have a dependency on other teams, so may not be immediate!
* Communities of practice for people to share knowledge and approaches between teams.
* Documented standards around things like code review, accessibility, security and governance.

The work of a team is defined by the governance of the University. Teams are able to propose programmes of work to our decision-makers, or be asked to deliver to a certain project outcome.

The team has a backlog of work including:

* Project work to introduce new services or user journeys or make significant improvements
* Support work to maintain existing services and user journeys
* Continuous improvement work to make small changes to existing services and user journeys

A project team can align themselves with a service delivery team during the period they are working together. For example, a project manager and a business analyst working on an assessment and feedback project would align with the Teaching and Learning service delivery team. Once that project has ended, the project manager and business analyst might be aligned to a different team.

All of the teams work should be in the backlog and the team should make a road map available to their stakeholders.

A road map should:

* Talk about outcomes not features
* Have a minimum horizon of 3 months
* Include milestones with target dates

This road map should be discussed and agreed by the relevant governing group or person. For example, a systems strategy group.

Teams should make a Service Level Agreement available to their users so that they know what to expect.

In order to plan their work and make it visible to their stakeholders, a team should hold a regular:

* Planning meeting
* Retrospective
* Showcase
