## Roles

One person may have several roles, but it should be agreed by the whole team who is performing what role. Roles can be adopted by people regardless of seniority, more senior people may be better suited for certain roles as they can bring more expertise and experience.

The structure is flat, with everybody contributing to the team output. The team is the unit of delivery. We are all trying to solve the same problem and everybody is welcome to contribute outside of their role in line with our [team values](values.md).
