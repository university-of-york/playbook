# Playbook

This branch contains the github pages that run on https://university-of-york.github.io/playbook/.

To make changes create PRs from this branch.

The idea of this being in version control is that we can use the general git flow to manage our playbook and create PRs for decisions in the same way that we would as code.

For more details check out the [playbook](https://university-of-york.github.io/playbook/) :)
