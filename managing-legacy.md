## Managing legacy

We take a pragmatic view to our legacy applications at the university, we have code that is many years old running important business functions for the University that needs to be maintained as well as maintaining future projects.

This document is is very much inspired by the government guidance on [Managing legacy technology](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-legacy-technology).

We are making the transition over to [service delivery teams](service-delivery-teams.md) and as part of this transition we have split down the portfolio of applications across the relevant teams.

This is currently mapped in a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/xfwEF8HJ/esg-service-ownership) and will be for the forseeable future.

As part of service ownership a team will be expected to triage the applications in their portfolion and apply the [5 Rs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-legacy-technology#issues-that-stop-legacy-technology-migration) to each of those applications:

* retain (do nothing)
* retire (drop)
* re-host (lift and shift)
* repurchase (shop and drop)
* re-platform (lift and shape)

This work will involve the teams to gauge the maintenance involved in *retain* and almost certainly Product Owners and Business Analysts for any final decisions.
